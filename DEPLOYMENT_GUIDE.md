# 🚀 Deployment Fix Guide

## ✅ Backend (Render) - WORKING
Your backend is already deployed and working at: https://nilu-s-crochet.onrender.com

### Health Check: ✅ PASSED
- URL: https://nilu-s-crochet.onrender.com/api/health
- Status: Connected to MongoDB
- Stats: 12 users, 10 products, 0 orders

## 🔧 Frontend (Vercel) - NEEDS REDEPLOY

### Current Issue
Your Vercel frontend is calling `https://nilucrochet.vercel.app/api/...` instead of your Render backend.

### Environment Variable Status
✅ You've already set `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://nilu-s-crochet.onrender.com/api` on Vercel

### Required Action: REDEPLOY
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/ketanop321/nilu-crochet
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
4. **OR** Push a new commit to trigger auto-deploy

## 🔍 How to Verify Fix

### After Redeploy:
1. Visit: https://nilucrochet.vercel.app
2. Open browser DevTools → Network tab
3. Try to login with: `admin` / `admin123`
4. Check network requests should go to: `https://nilu-s-crochet.onrender.com/api/auth/login`

### Expected Results:
- ✅ Login should work (may take 50s first time - Render cold start)
- ✅ Products should load on homepage  
- ✅ Admin panel should be accessible

## 🚨 If Still Not Working

### Manual Trigger Deploy:
```bash
# Push any small change to trigger redeploy
git add .
git commit -m "trigger redeploy with correct env"
git push origin main
```

### Verify Environment Variables:
1. Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → Environment Variables
2. Confirm: `VITE_API_BASE_URL = https://nilu-s-crochet.onrender.com/api`
3. Ensure it's set for "All Environments"

## 📋 Backend Updates Made
- ✅ Added CORS support for your Vercel domains
- ✅ Updated environment to accept production frontend URL

## 🎯 Next Steps
1. **REDEPLOY** your Vercel frontend (most important!)
2. Test login/register functionality  
3. Test admin panel access
4. Verify product loading on homepage

Your backend is working perfectly. The issue is just that your frontend build needs to use the updated environment variable.
